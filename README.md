# Describing Distributions


## Introduction

In this assignment, you will be analyzing & visualizing several features using this [Medical Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1APV3pXiAszS_0mSgkiEt9IUNH-QmyX7KwxSAwuADl6Y/gviz/tq?tqx=out:csv&sheet=medical_data).

## Problem Description

**The features to analyze:**

- VitD_levels
- Doc_visits
- TotalCharge

**For each feature listed:**

- Plot a histogram with a kde (kernel density estimate)
- Add a line for the mean (red)
- Add a line for the median (green)
- Add a line for for +1 std from the mean (black)
- Add a line for the - 1 std from the mean (black)
- Highlight the range between +1 and =1 std (yellow)

## Solution Description

**Answer the following questions:**

- Is it Discrete or Continuous?
- Does it have a skew? If so, which direction (+/-)
- What type of kurtosis does it display? (Mesokurtic, Leptokurtic, Platykurtic)
